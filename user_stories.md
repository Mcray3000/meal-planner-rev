1. As a college student living on campus I have limited groceries and I am tired of the same chicken and rice dish, I am wanting to spice up my dinner and come up with a new recipe.

1 (exception). This college student may not have many options if their groceries are very limited their may not be a different recipe that pulls up, but we could suggest other spices to allow for different flavor.

2. As a mom of a family of 7 I want to create a big batch dinner that is different from lasagna or pasta that will allow for leftovers.

2(exception). An error that could occur is that the portion sizing may be slightly off depending on how much some members in the family eat so we should provide a range.

3. As a young adult living alone for the first week I want to get out of repetition and try new recipes I haven't thought of.

3(exception). An error that could occur is some of the options that come up could include ingredients or brands that the person does not have access to so that could create some confusion/issues. 

4. As a professional chef looking for some inpsiration, a some new recipes will enhance my menu.
   Exception. Chef already has seen the recipe, put a line are you happy with your recipe y/n? n will find the next best thing.

5. As a fitness freak looking to bulk up to get swole. I want the most calorie dense options.
   Exception. Not enough calories. Raise a suggestion on how to dense up the recipe with a few quick tricks, or recomend close recipes that are calorie dense.

   6. As a really busy individual who doesn't have time to cook throughout the week, I am looking for a meal plan that will be able to survive the week.
      Exception. Food is incompatible with weekwide storage. Suggest foods that don't go bad, or a simplier recipe that will survive the length of the work week.
