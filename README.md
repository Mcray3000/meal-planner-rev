## Pitch 
Have you ever been unsure of what to cook or bake based on your limited kitchen ingredients and supplies? Our backend API service stores recipes for anyone from college students to professional chefs looking to innovate their menus. Our service generates recipes based on ingredients you have in stock, in addition to your individual skill level and available supplies. We automate painful meal planning and showcase personalized meals on the fly - allowing you to focus on the fun parts of cooking and baking. In addition to ready to go plans, we offer recipe suggestions that only require a few more ingredients - and give you the ability to order them.
