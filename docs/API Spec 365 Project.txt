1. Personalized Recipe Creation Following College student story
   1. As a college student living on campus I have limited groceries and I am tired of the same bland salt, pepper, chicken and rice dish. I am wanting to spice up my dinner and come up with a new recipe.

        "recipes": [
                     {
                        "id": "1", 
                        "recipe_name": "Chicken Fried Rice",                                           "ingredients": ["oil, chicken, day old rice, soy sauce, salt, pepper, frozen veggies, eggs"],
                         “instructions": "Heat up some oil in a pan and put the chicken on it and season with Salt and Pepper. Once chicken is cooked, move to the side and begin cooking the veggies and  rice. Heat up more oil on  a pan and put the veggies in. Once veggies begin to soften, throw the rice in and douse in soy sauce and some more pepper. Finally after rice and veggies are almost cooked, move the rice over and crack the eggs in the pan and scramble them. Allow full mixture to cook and then the grub is ready! ",
